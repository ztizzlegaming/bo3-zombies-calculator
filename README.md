### What is this? How do I use this?
This is a small utility to calculate certain statistics for Black Ops 3 zombies. To use it, you just type in how many people are in your game of zombies, the round number, and check if Double XP is on. The program will show you the number of zombies that round, total number of zombies so far in the game, the zombies' health, and xp earned that round and in the entire game.
